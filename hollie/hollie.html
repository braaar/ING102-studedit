 <h2>Min Stilling i Gruppen</h2>
 <p>Jeg er en medlem og <span class="meme", onmousedown="alert('1 EXT. SPACE A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity. War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . . PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakins ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wans ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet. 2 INT. OBI-WANS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently. 3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER. ANAKIN: There isnt a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . . OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . . 4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame. 5 INT. OBI-WANS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship. OBI-WAN: Weve got to split them up. ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower. OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow. OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait? ANAKIN: Dont worry. Im coming around behind you. OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starships superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire. OBI-WAN: Anakin, theyre all over me! ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo! ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning. ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo. OBI-WAN: Im going down on the deck. ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN. ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Dont let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER. OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I dont like this! OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wans wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wans Astro Droid, ARFOUR. OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch! R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. OBI-WAN: (continuing) Dont even try to fix it, Arfour. Ive shut it down. ANAKIN: Were locked on ... weve got him . . . ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight. ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo. OBI-WAN: Next time youre the bait . . . Now lets find the Command Ship and get on with it ... R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievouss ship is directly ahead. ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakins cockpit. ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids. 6 INT. OBI-WANS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS. ANAKIN: Come on, Master. OBI-WAN: Not this time. Theres too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy? ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader. OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . . 7 INT. ODD BALLS FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE ODD BALL: Were on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position. The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings. 8 INT. ANAKINS FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side. ARTOO BEEPS a worried message. OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . . ANAKIN: Im going head to head. See you. OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin. Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi. ODD BALL: Im on your right, Red Leader. ANAKIN: Incoming!! ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right. OBI-WAN: Five more on the right! Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS. ANAKIN: Here we go. The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE. OBI-WAN: Im going high and right. ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them. OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us. ANAKIN: Im coming around. Im coming around on your tail. OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash. In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS. ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him. ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . thats not good. OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail. ANAKIN: I know. I know! OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left. ANAKIN: I know. I know! OBI-WAN: Break right and go high. ANAKIN: Im going low and left. Obi-Wan shakes his head. OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn. ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence. ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? Im going to pull them through the needle . . . OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: Survive. ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little. OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts. OBI-WAN: (continuing) Youll never get through there, Anakin. Its too tight. ARTOO BEEPS nervously. ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . weve done this before. OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow. ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoos squeal reads out, WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo. ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH. ANAKIN: (continuing) Im through. OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. ODD BALL: There are too many of them. CLONE PILOT 2: Im on your wing. Break left. Break left. Theyre all over me. Get them off my . . . ANAKIN: Im going to go help them out! OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship! Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them. ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up! ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . . The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wans ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. ANAKIN: Theyre coming around! OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy. ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide. ANAKIN: We got em. Artoo! Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan. OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids. Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. OBI-WAN: (continuing) Im hit! Anakin? ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids. The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wans ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR. OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . ARFOURs head gets ripped off and flies away. OBI-WAN: Oh dear. Theyre shutting down all the controls. ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! Im running out of tricks here. ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wans left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wans ship. OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ... ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . . OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. Youre not helping here. ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I cant see a thing! My cockpits fogging. Theyre all over me, Anakin. ANAKIN: Move to the right. OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. Youre going to get us both killed! Get out of here. Theres nothing more you can do. ANAKIN: Im not leaving without you, Master. ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WANs and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WANs ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wans ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedis view. ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakins ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID. OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I cant see . . . my controls are gone. ANAKIN: Get em, Artoo. Watch out! OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droids center eye. ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him! OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo. ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the Generals Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up? ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master. ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WANs disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES. OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this. 9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space. ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut. OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions. ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN. OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor. ANAKIN: Tap into the ships computers. They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears. OBI-WAN: The Chancellors signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire. ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . . OBI-WAN: I sense a trap. ANAKIN: Next move? OBI-WAN: Spring the trap. The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO. ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship. OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders. OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO. 10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN. GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Whats the situation, Captain? CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted. 11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUSs BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. Weve been waiting for you. OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back. OBI-WAN: Anakin. . . ANAKIN: Ready. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor. 12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it. OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. Thats why theyve stopped shooting. ANAKIN: Well then, were safe for the time being. OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine. They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers. ANAKIN: Theyre sealing this section off. OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way! The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance. ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way. They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers. OBI-WAN: Well never get through that. Its too small!')">meme</span> provider for gruppen.</p>
